jQuery .scrollintoview() plugin <sup>(with additional :scrollable selector filter)</sup>
--
This plugin makes it easy to scroll any element on your page into view. It scrolls in a user friendly way using animation (speed can be configured) so users never loose track where they moved within the current page. Default browser functionality simply jumps to some element which may confure users greatly.
